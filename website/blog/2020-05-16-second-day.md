Second day trying to use TensorFlow.js/ml5.js

<!--truncate-->

The next video I watch was
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNkAuWz5lnY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y).
So one thing to know about a pretrained model is "What is the model trained on".
For example if a model was only trainged to recognize the colors red or blue
then giving it the color green might not go so well for it since it has not been
trained on green. The example for the video can be found
[here](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library/blob/a7ef75408d35e9dd1b89f3d4bcb36783cb966590/src/utils/IMAGENET_CLASSES.js)
show all the classes that the imagenet knows.

So time for actual coding. I got the starting code from [here](https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/tree/master/learning/ml5/1.1_image_classification/P5).
